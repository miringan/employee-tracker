## Description
Employee Tracker is a command line program that allows a user to track the employees of a company with a dynamically controlled SQL database. It contains three tables, them being department, roles, and employee. The user will be able to view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role. All actions are accomplished through asynchronous functions that execute SQL statements.
